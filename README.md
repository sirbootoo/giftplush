This is a demo tutorial of all the technologies I have used so far in Angular 4.

# Technologies

1. Algolia Instantsearch.js.
2. Paystack Inline.
3. Cloudinary.
4. Firebase.

## Algolia Instantsearch.js

This is responsible for the searches. It is awesome.
It helps with indexing your searches and producing a very responsive list.

It has features like

* Realtime Searching
* Search Analytics
* Indexing
* Textual relevance
* Security
* Search UI

I implemented the Algolia Instantsearch.js in the [Select Voucher Page](https://github.com/sirbootoo/giftplush/blob/master/src/app/_components/pick/selectvoucher.component.ts)

 ## Paystack Inline
 
 This is a Nigerian start-up which is also operating in the states. Mad right ?
 
 It is a payment platform which is incredibly easy to use. Although they stole some concepts from STRIPE but mehn they sure made it work very well. Their easy to integrate system made them my personal favourite and in this tutorial I used their payment platform in the [Pick Placeholder page](https://github.com/sirbootoo/giftplush/blob/master/src/app/_components/pick/placeorder.component.ts).
